Economists have long recognized that pesticide susceptibility is a dynamic resource and that economic tools developed for such resources can be useful for improving management. One tool this paper introduces is the ‘marginal user cost’ of resistance. Measuring the future pesticide benefits foregone by an additional unit of pesticide use today, this value is the most appropriate candidate for defining the price of pesticide resistance. In other areas of resource economics, such as climate change, analogous estimates have proven to be essential ingredients in making more efficient economic policy. To advance the use of this measure, we use stochastic dynamic programming in a generic bioeconomic model of pesticide resistance developed from prior literature, demonstrate computation of marginal user costs, and examine its variation in a largescale global sensitivity analysis. The most impactful parameters on optimal pesticide use and marginal user costs are the discount rate, density dependence of the pest population, genetic dominance of resistance, and pesticide cost-effectiveness. The least impactful parameter is the fitness cost of resistance, which is noteworthy because of much prior attention paid to this parameter in the resistance management literature. We establish that the marginal user cost is sometimes positive or negative at empirically relevant pest densities, depending on the relative gains from reducing pesticide use to preserve future effectiveness versus increasing use to limit future growth and spread of the pest population.</p>

										<h3>Economic optimization of Wolbachia-infected Aedes aegypti releases to prevent to dengue</h3>
										<p style="text-transform: inherit;">with Brandon D. Hollingsworth, Michael Vella, Hyeongyul Roh, Julian Sass, Alun L. Lloyd, and Zachary S. Brown</p>
										<p style="text-transform: inherit; line-height:1.8;">Dengue is a systemic viral infection spread most commonly by the mosquito Aedes aegypti. The virus infects approximately 390 million individuals a year worldwide. Currently, the only available vaccines, Dengvaxia, is only approved for individuals with a confirmed previous dengue infection, and vector control through conventional methods has proven inefficient and costly. Recently, there have been several novel vector control techniques proposed to prevent dengue outbreaks. One of the most promising relies on infection with the bacterium, Wolbachia. In Ae. aegypti, the Wolbachia is a vertically transmitted chronic infection, reducing the fitness of infected mosquitoes and blocking their ability to transmit dengue.  Additionally, cytoplasmic incompatibility enables super-Mendelian inheritance, allowing for Wolbachia to spread to fixation in vector populations. However, economically efficient release strategies – optimizing both the rate of insect releases and the sizing of rearing facility capacity – have not yet been well characterized. In this paper, we describe a simple, model-based framework for making these decisions based on stochastic dynamic programming techniques. Using this framework, we find that conditional on sufficiently high facility capacity, the efficient strategy is robustly characterized as releasing at maximal rates initially before rapidly tapering to full cessation. Using empirical values for the biological and economic parameters in the model, we subsequently find that the optimal facility capacity is inelastic with respect to the baseline carrying capacity of the vector population. These results provide lessons for optimizing Wolbachia-based Aedes aegypti control programs, and for thinking about the efficiency of other, self-sustaining biological interventions for vector control.</p>
