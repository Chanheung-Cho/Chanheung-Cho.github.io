						<strong style="font-size:17px;">Economic Optimization of Wolbachia-infected Aedes aegypti Release to Prevent Dengue</strong><br>
						Brandon D. Hollingsworth, Chanheung Cho, Michael Vella, Hyeongyul Roh, Julian Sass, Alun L. Lloyd, Zachary S. Brown<br><br>
						BACKGROUND Dengue virus, primarily transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, is a major public health concern affecting ≈3.83 billion people worldwide. Recent releases of Wolbachia-transinfected Ae. aegypti in several cities worldwide have shown that it can reduce dengue transmission. However, these releases are costly, and, to date, no framework has been proposed for determining economically optimal release strategies that account for both costs associated with disease risk and releases. RESULTS We present a flexible stochastic dynamic programming framework for determining optimal release schedules for Wolbachia-transinfected mosquitoes that balances the cost of dengue infection with the costs of rearing and releasing transinfected mosquitoes. Using an ordinary differential equation model of Wolbachia and dengue in a hypothetical city loosely describing areas at risk of new dengue epidemics, we determined that an all-or-nothing release strategy that quickly brings Wolbachia to fixation is often the optimal solution. Based on this, we examined the optimal facility size, finding that it was inelastic with respect to the mosquito population size, with a 100% increase in population size resulting in a 50–67% increase in optimal facility size. Furthermore, we found that these results are robust to mosquito life-history parameters and are mostly determined by the mosquito population size and the fitness costs associated with Wolbachia. CONCLUSIONS These results reinforce that Wolbachia-transinfected mosquitoes can reduce the cost of dengue epidemics. Furthermore, they emphasize the importance of determining the size of the target population and fitness costs associated with Wolbachia before releases occur..

						<strong style="font-size:17px;">Developing Practical Measures of the Price of Pesticide Resistance: A Flexible Computational Framework with Global Sensitivity Analysis</strong><br>
						Chanheung Cho, Zachary S. Brown, Kevin Gross, Daniel Tregeagle<br><br>
						Pesticide resistance poses an increasing challenge for agricultural sustainability. Pesticide susceptibility is a depletable biological resource, but resistance management rarely quantifies marginal, forward-looking economic costs to users of depletion. To facilitate the development of such costs, we use a generic stochastic bioeconomic model of resistance evolution in a crop pest population, stochastic dynamic programming, and global sensitivity analysis to analyze the “marginal user costs” of resistance. The most impactful parameters are population density dependence and pesticide prices. The least impactful is the fitness cost of resistance, which is noteworthy because of prior emphasis on this parameter in the resistance management literature.

						<strong style="font-size:17px;">Film Quality and Screen Allocation of Vertically Integrated Theaters</strong><br>
						Chanheung Cho, Sung-Hwan Kim<br><br>
						This study empirically examines how Korean movie theaters allocate screens, concentrating on two variables, film quality and vertical integration. While it is already shown by the existing works that vertical integration causes discrimination in screen allocation, we go further and investigate four hypothetical incentives for such discrimination - internalization of distribution margin, strategic discrimination, information asymmetry, and dynamic profit. Our analysis of the first week of release confirms the presence of discrimination in which vertically integrated theaters allocate more screens to their own films. And we find that it is more likely to be due to the incentive of strategic discrimination rather than internalization of distribution margin. This finding is consistent with the competition concern raised recently in Korea. However, the analysis of the second week of release shows that the effect of earlier discrimination partly disappears later, which is likely to be due to resolving the information asymmetry.
